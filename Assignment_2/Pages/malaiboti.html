    <h1>Malai Boti</h1>

    <p> Malai Boti aka Malai Tikka are melt-in-the-mouth chunks of boneless chicken marinated in a mildly flavoured
        cream sauce made with fresh herbs. The chicken is so succulent and perfect to enjoy with a green chutney as an
        appetizer or put into parathas or wraps for a full meal. You can grill, bake or pan-fry this versatile dish!

    <h1>Nalli Nihari</h1>
    <p> The word nalli means pipe or tube, which conveys the pipe-like bones that are used to make nihari. Nalli Nihari
        is made with beef bones (typically humerus or femur), which contain yellow bone marrow. This gives Nihari a
        rich, buttery flavor. Sometimes, the bone marrow is extracted and added to the Nihari.

        This recipe doesn’t require bones, but using bone-in meat or bones alongside the meat will enhance the flavor
        (it’s more essential in the Instant Pot version). If you do use bones, you would need around 1/3 lb extra weight
        in bones. </p>

    <h1>Ras Malai</h1>

    <p> Ras malai, originally [citation needed] known as rosomalai, or roshmalai, is a dessert from the Indian
        subcontinent. The dessert is called roshmalai/rosmalai in Bengali,[1] ras malai in Hindi, and rasa malei in
        Odia. It is popular in India, Bangladesh and Pakistan.

        The origin of the sweet is impossible to verify but there are alternate stories identifying an origin in the
        Bengal region. </p>

    <h1> Chicken Sandwich </h1>

    <p> A club sandwich, also called a clubhouse sandwich, is a sandwich consisting of bread (traditionally toasted),
        sliced cooked poultry, fried bacon, lettuce, tomato, and mayonnaise. It is often cut into quarters or
        halves and held together by cocktail sticks. Modern versions frequently have two layers which are separated by
        an additional slice of bread. </p>

    <h1>Chicken Jalfrezi</h1>

    <p> Chicken Jalfrezi is a tomato-based curry made with boneless chicken pieces, bell peppers, and onion.

        Unlike most traditional curries, Jalfrezi is often stir-fried instead of stewed or braised. This lends it a
        thick, semi-dry texture instead of a soupy one like that of Classic Chicken Curry. </p>

    <h1>Chow Mein</h1>

    <p> Chow mein is a traditional Chinese dish made with egg noodles and stir-fried veggies. We love adding a protein
        and our favorite is chicken, but you can try different meat or tofu. This dish is pan-fried so the noodles get a
        nice crisp to them and then tossed in a yummy sauce. Chow mein is perfect for those nights when you don’t want
        to dirty too many pans or make a big mess of the kitchen.

        Chow mein gets its signature flavor from the thick, dark homemade sauce the noodles are tossed with. It’s the
        perfect balance of sweet and salty and makes putting down your chopsticks absolutely impossible. </p>

    <h1>Bihari Boti</h1>

    <p> One of the most popular dishes in Pakistaniâ€™s history that are widely enjoyed especially during barbecue nights,
        Eid dinners or a night out with the family is the infamous Bihari Boti.

        The Bihari Boti is also commonly known as Bihari Kabab even though Turks are known to make the first form of
        kababs and the Bihari boti or kababs is made with meat chunks like in the ancient times, it is nothing like the
        kababs that the Turks must have eaten. Instead it has upgraded to a delicious, melt-in-the mouth texture,
        infused with spices, yougurt and tenderising papaya.

        Its pretty evident through the name that the Bihari Boti derived from Bihar and even though Bihar is
        traditionally vegetarian and are known for cooking vegetable dishes to perfection. </p>

    <h1>Tandoori Tikka</h1>

    <p> Undoubtedly Tandoori chicken is the king of all tikkas in the tandoor repertoire. Amidst all the street food,
        kebabs, tikkas, biryanis and grilled meats Iâ€™ve scoffed down over the years in India and the UK; this dish is a
        firm fixture on every restaurant and street cart menu. There is an array of tandoori chicken dishes on offer and
        a few I have covered on the blog as well including Kali Mirch Murgh Tikka cooked with crushed black pepper and
        also my favorite recipe Kandhari Murgh Tikka cooked in pomegranate molasses and spices. </p>

    <h1>Shahi Tukra</h1>

    <p> Shahi means royal, and tukda means piece. Shahi Tukda translates to a royal dessert that was perfect for serving kings and queens.

        It is made by deep-frying the bread slices in ghee and then soaking them in flavored sugar syrup. These pieces are then topped with thick rabdi and slivered dry fruits. 
        
        Shahi Tukra is very popular in the Hyderabadi and Awadhi cuisine. It is an excellent dessert for festivals like Ramadan (Iftar), Eid, Holi, and Diwali.  </p>

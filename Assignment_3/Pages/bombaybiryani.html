    <h1>Bombay Biryani</h1>
    <p> Bombay biryani is a variety of Indian biryani, consisting of layers of flavored basmati rice, potatoes, chunks
        of chicken, mutton, lamb or vegetables, alongside some fried onions, mint leaves, and dried plums. Rice is
        boiled with a variety of spices, the meat and potatoes are fried, and everything is layered in a pot.

        The dish is typically finished with melted ghee on top and enjoyed with cooling raita and a fresh salad on the
        side. This variety of biryani is distinguished by a mild sweetness imparted by the dried plums, kewra essence,
        and fried onions used in its preparation.

        Another distinctive feature of this dish is the presence of fried potatoes, which is unusual for other biryanis.

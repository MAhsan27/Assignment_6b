    <h1>Nihari</h1>
    <p> Nihari is a rich, slow-cooked meat stew flavored with spices and thickened with atta, or Pakistani &
        Indian-style durum whole wheat flour. Pakistani versions of Nihari are typically made with beef, but Nihari can
        be made with lamb, goat meat, or chicken. </p>
